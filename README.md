What's this?
============

This is a package of software to play around with audio, particularly
"spectrally simple" sounds (such as whistling) obtained from a mic.

It contains an analyzer (`abora-studio`) which a user can use to
transcribe an audio file into a digitized melody, e.g. timing and
frequency information. The analyzer takes an audio file as input
and serves a transcription UI on a web interface (by default, on
port 8099).

It also contains (currently very rudimentary) synthesizing features
to play back melodies using such timing and frequency information.

What sort of state is it in?
============================

Everything in here is pretty rough. This is just the result of me
playing around with audio, and it might be useful for someone else
exploring the same stuff. It's not an "end-user-ready" product.
